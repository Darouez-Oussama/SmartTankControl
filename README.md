# Smart Tank Control System with Arduino Cloud

This project implements an automated water tank monitoring and pump control system using Arduino Cloud. The system monitors the water level in a tank and automatically adjusts the pump voltage to maintain optimal water levels.

## Overview

This smart tank control system utilizes Arduino Cloud to create an automated water management solution. It provides real-time monitoring of tank water levels and intelligent pump control, allowing for efficient water management and preventing tank overflow or dry running of the pump.

## Features

- Real-time water tank level monitoring
- Automatic pump voltage adjustment based on tank level
- Remote monitoring through Arduino Cloud dashboard
- Mobile access via Arduino IoT Cloud Remote app
- Real-time data visualization of tank levels and pump performance

## Support
